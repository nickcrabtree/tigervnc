# SEP (Someone Else's Problem) Index

This directory contains Scoped Enhancement Proposals (SEPs) that define features explicitly **out-of-scope** for the Rust VNC Viewer project.

## Active SEPs

- **[SEP-0001: Out-of-Scope Features](SEP-0001-out-of-scope.md)** - Defines touch support, settings UI, and screenshot functionality as out-of-scope for v0.x

## Purpose

SEP documents serve to:
- Explicitly document what the project will **not** implement
- Provide rationale for scope decisions
- Offer alternatives and workarounds for excluded features
- Define criteria for potential future reconsideration
- Focus engineering resources on core objectives

## SEP Process

SEPs are created when features are considered but explicitly rejected from project scope. They document the decision-making process and prevent repeated discussions about the same topics.

All SEPs require approval from project maintainers and represent firm commitments to scope management.
