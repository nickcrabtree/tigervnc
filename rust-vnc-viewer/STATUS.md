# Rust VNC Viewer - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Phase 7 IN PROGRESS 🚧 — GUI viewer compiling; input handling complete  
**Last Updated**: Phases 1-6 complete; Phase 7 (GUI) being finalized.

## Summary

- ✅ Phases 1–6 complete (core protocol through input handling)
- 🚧 Phase 7 in progress (GUI integration - rvncviewer compiles, needs final integration)
- ✅ Working GUI skeleton (`rvncviewer`) with all UI components implemented
- 📈 Tests: 336+ across workspace (16 tests in platform-input)
- 🚀 Performance: All performance targets met
- 🔜 Next: Complete Phase 7 integration, then Phase 8 (advanced features)

## Build & Test Status

```bash
# Build all
cargo build && cargo build --release

# Run tests (workspace)
cargo test
```
