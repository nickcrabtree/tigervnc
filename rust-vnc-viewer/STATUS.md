# Rust VNC Viewer - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Phase 5 COMPLETE âœ… â€” rfb-client and rfb-display finished; GUI viewer functional  
**Last Updated**: Phase 5 complete; rendering, scaling, viewport, cursor, multi-monitor implemented.

## Summary

- âœ… Phases 1â€“5 complete (core protocol, encodings, client library, display/rendering)
- âœ… Working GUI viewer (`njcvncviewer-rs`) built on `rfb-client` + `rfb-display`
- ðŸ“ˆ Tests: 320+ across workspace (including 68 in rfb-display)
- ðŸš€ Performance: Scaling calculations < 0.02Âµs; 60 fps target easily met
- ðŸ”œ Next: Phase 6 (input), Phase 7 (GUI polish), Phase 8 (advanced features)

See also: `PHASE4_COMPLETE.md`, `PHASE5_COMPLETE.md` for detailed completion reports.

## Workspace Structure

- âœ… Root `Cargo.toml` with workspace members
- âœ… Workspace-wide dependency configuration
- âœ… Build verified via `cargo build` (debug and release)

## Crate Status

### rfb-common â€” COMPLETE âœ…
- Core geometry/config types (Point, Rect, Cursor, etc.)

### rfb-pixelbuffer â€” COMPLETE âœ…
- PixelFormat (RGB888 and others), PixelBuffer/MutablePixelBuffer traits
- ManagedPixelBuffer implementation, rect ops, stride-in-pixels docs
- 19 unit tests passing

### rfb-protocol â€” COMPLETE âœ…
- Sockets, buffered I/O, state machine, messages, handshake (RFB 3.3/3.8)
- 118 tests passing; zero clippy warnings

### rfb-encodings â€” COMPLETE âœ…
- Raw, CopyRect, RRE, Hextile, Tight, ZRLE; Decoder trait + registry
- 93 tests passing; comprehensive docs

### rfb-client â€” COMPLETE âœ… (Phase 4)
- Async client library: connection lifecycle, transport (TCP/TLS), config, errors
- Protocol helpers, framebuffer, event loop, CLI (feature-gated)
- Tests: 21 unit + 11 doctests + 5 integration (4 ignored) per PHASE4 report

### rfb-display â€” COMPLETE âœ… (Phase 5)
- Pixels/wgpu-based renderer with scaling (Native, Fit, Fill), viewport, cursor, multi-monitor, DPI
- Performance validated; 68 tests (unit+integration+perf) passing

### platform-input â€” PLANNED (Phase 6)
- Keyboard/mouse/gestures, throttling, shortcuts

### njcvncviewer-rs â€” WORKING âœ…
- egui-based GUI; integrates `rfb-client` + `rfb-display`

## Build & Test Status

```bash
# Build all
cargo build && cargo build --release

# Run tests (workspace)
cargo test
```

- âœ… Debug/release builds clean
- âœ… All unit/integration/doc tests passing across crates
- âœ… Clippy clean on implemented crates

## Statistics (Workspace)

- Total LOC: ~13,000+ (code + docs + tests)
- Tests passing: 320+ (including 68 in rfb-display)
- Crates complete: 6/8 (Phases 1â€“5)

## Recent Activity (2025-10-23)

- âœ… Phase 5 COMPLETE: rfb-display (scaling, viewport, cursor, multi-monitor, DPI)
- âœ… Phase 4 COMPLETE: rfb-client (connection lifecycle, event loop, framebuffer updates)
- ðŸ“ˆ Added 68 tests; all passing
- ðŸš€ Fit/Fill scaling calculations < 0.02Âµs each

## Next Phases

### Phase 6: Input Handling
- Keyboard mapping to RFB keysyms; mouse buttons/scroll; gesture support (winit)
- Pointer throttling; shortcuts; view-only mode integration

### Phase 7: GUI Integration
- Menus, dialogs, fullscreen, status overlays; preferences persistence

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- Clipboard, TLS, listen mode, SSH tunnel integration
- ContentCache protocol (client-side) â€” see `RUST_VIEWER_STATUS.md` (Phase 8)
