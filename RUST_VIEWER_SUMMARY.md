# Rust VNC Viewer Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: ✅ Two working implementations with advanced encodings

The Rust VNC implementation now includes **two complementary components**:

1. **`njcvncviewer-rs`** - Complete GUI viewer application with egui
2. **`rfb-client`** - High-level async VNC client library

## Crate Structure (After Merge)

```
rust-vnc-viewer/
├── rfb-common/          ✅ Complete
├── rfb-pixelbuffer/     ✅ Complete
├── rfb-protocol/        ✅ Complete
├── rfb-encodings/       ✅ Complete (Raw, CopyRect, RRE, Hextile, Tight, ZRLE)
├── rfb-client/          ✅ Complete (async library)
└── njcvncviewer-rs/     ✅ Working (GUI viewer)
```

## Key Changes from Merge

- **Added rfb-encodings**: All 6 standard encodings now implemented (Tight, ZRLE, Hextile, RRE, Raw, CopyRect)
- **Added rfb-client**: Reusable async VNC client library with connection management, transport layer, and event loop
- **Kept njcvncviewer-rs**: Standalone GUI viewer application
- **Tests**: 250+ tests passing (was 165+)
- **LOC**: ~12,000+ (was ~7,000)

## Next Steps

Focus on ContentCache integration (4 weeks) - See `rust-vnc-viewer/CONTENTCACHE_QUICKSTART.md` for detailed plan.
