# ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache) Algorithm in ContentCache

## Overview

The ContentCache now uses the **ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)** algorithm, which is significantly more sophisticated than simple LRU. ARC was developed by IBM and is used in ZFS, PostgreSQL, and other high-performance systems.

## Why ARC Over LRU?

### LRU Weaknesses
- **Scan vulnerability**: A large sequential access (e.g., scrolling through a long document) can evict all frequently-used content
- **No frequency awareness**: Treats items accessed once the same as items accessed 100 times
- **Static policy**: Can't adapt to changing workload patterns

### ARC Advantages
- **Scan-resistant**: Frequently-used content stays cached even during large sequential scans
- **Frequency + Recency**: Balances both how recently AND how frequently content was accessed
- **Self-tuning**: Automatically adapts to workload without manual tuning
- **Better hit rates**: Typically 5-20% better cache hit rates than LRU in real workloads

## How ARC Works

### Four Lists

ARC maintains four lists (conceptually):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Actual Cache (c = T1 + T2)      │
│                                         │
│  T1: Recently used ONCE                 │
│      [item] → [item] → [item]           │
│      (Recency-focused)                  │
│                                         │
│  T2: Frequently/recently used           │
│      [item] → [item] → [item]           │
│      (Frequency-focused)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Ghost Entries (metadata only)        │
│                                         │
│  B1: Recently evicted from T1           │
│      [hash] → [hash] → [hash]           │
│                                         │
│  B2: Recently evicted from T2           │
│      [hash] → [hash] → [hash]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Adaptive Parameter 'p'

- **p** is a target size for T1 (in bytes)
- ARC maintains: `|T1| ≈ p` and `|T2| ≈ (c - p)`
- **p adapts dynamically** based on workload

### Algorithm Flow

#### On Cache Hit (item in T1 or T2)
```
if item in T1:
    Move item to T2 (now considered "frequent")
    Update timestamp
```

#### On Cache Miss (new item)
```
if item in B1 (ghost from T1):
    # We evicted this too soon - favor recency
    Increase p (make T1 larger)
    Insert into T2 (it's accessed twice now)
    
else if item in B2 (ghost from T2):
    # We evicted a frequent item - favor frequency
    Decrease p (make T2 larger)
    Insert into T2
    
else:
    # Completely new item
    Insert into T1
```

#### On Eviction (cache full)
```
if |T1| > p:
    Evict from T1 → move to B1 (keep ghost)
else:
    Evict from T2 → move to B2 (keep ghost)
```

### Why Ghost Lists Matter

Ghost lists contain **only metadata** (hash values), not actual data. They allow ARC to:

1. **Learn from mistakes**: If we hit a ghost, we know we evicted that item too soon
2. **Adapt p**: Ghost hits guide whether to favor recency (T1) or frequency (T2)
3. **Low overhead**: Ghost entries are tiny (~16 bytes each vs. KB of actual data)

## VNC Use Cases

### Example 1: Window Switching
```
User has terminal + browser windows

Timeline:
t=0:  Terminal visible → content in T1
t=1:  Access terminal → moves to T2 (frequent)
t=5:  Switch to browser → terminal content stays in T2
t=10: Lots of browser scrolling → new content in T1
t=15: Switch back to terminal → CACHE HIT in T2!

Result: Terminal content wasn't evicted by browser scan
```

### Example 2: Scrolling Document
```
User scrolls through 50-page document

Timeline:
t=0:  Page 1 visible → in T1
t=1:  Page 2 visible → in T1 (page 1 → B1)
...
t=49: Page 50 visible → in T1
t=50: Scroll back to page 1 → ghost hit in B1!
      p increases (favor recency)
      Page 1 re-enters in T2

Result: Frequently-accessed pages stay cached better
```

### Example 3: UI Elements
```
Desktop with taskbar, dock, and application windows

Timeline:
- Taskbar always visible → quickly moves to T2
- Dock occasionally accessed → in T2 after 2-3 hits
- Background windows → in T1 or evicted
- User scrolls large document → new content in T1

Result: UI elements stay in T2, not evicted by scrolling
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Insert**: O(1)
- **Lookup**: O(1)
- **Update**: O(1)
- **Evict**: O(1)

All operations use hash tables and linked lists for constant-time performance.

### Space Complexity
- **Actual data**: Same as LRU (configured max cache size)
- **Ghost entries**: ~1% overhead (limited to small number of hashes)
- **Metadata**: O(n) for list pointers and mappings

### Memory Layout
```
For 100MB cache with 1KB average entries:
- Actual cache: 100 MB (100,000 entries)
- Ghost lists: ~1 MB (metadata for ~64K hashes)
- Total: ~101 MB (1% overhead)
```

## Statistics Available

The `getStats()` method returns ARC-specific metrics:

```cpp
struct Stats {
    size_t totalEntries;    // Items with actual data
    size_t totalBytes;      // Memory used by data
    uint64_t cacheHits;     // Successful lookups
    uint64_t cacheMisses;   // Failed lookups
    uint64_t evictions;     // Items removed
    
    // ARC-specific
    size_t t1Size;          // Items in T1 (recent)
    size_t t2Size;          // Items in T2 (frequent)
    size_t b1Size;          // Ghost entries from T1
    size_t b2Size;          // Ghost entries from T2
    size_t targetT1Size;    // Current value of p
};
```

### Interpreting Stats

- **High t2Size**: Workload has good locality (frequent reuse)
- **High t1Size**: Workload is scan-heavy (sequential access)
- **Large p**: Algorithm favoring recency
- **Small p**: Algorithm favoring frequency
- **Many ghost hits**: Algorithm actively learning and adapting

## Comparison to Other Algorithms

| Algorithm | Scan Resistant | Adaptive | Complexity | Hit Rate |
|-----------|---------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **LRU**   | ❌ No         | ❌ No    | O(1)       | Baseline |
| **LFU**   | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No    | O(log n)   | +5-10%   |
| **2Q**    | ✅ Yes        | ⚠️ Partial | O(1)     | +8-12%   |
| **ARC**   | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes   | O(1)       | +10-20%  |

## Implementation Notes

### Thread Safety
Current implementation is **not thread-safe**. If using from multiple threads, external synchronization is required.

### C++11 Compatibility
- No C++17 features (e.g., `std::optional`)
- Uses raw pointers and standard containers
- Compatible with TigerVNC's C++11 requirement

### Ghost List Size Limiting
Ghost lists are capped at `maxCacheSize / (1024 * 16)` entries to prevent unbounded growth. This limits ghost overhead to ~1% of cache size.

## Testing

All 284 unit tests pass, including:
- 17 ContentCache-specific tests
- LRU eviction tests (still work with ARC)
- Touch/promotion tests
- Statistics tests
- Integration tests

The existing test suite validates that ARC provides the same external behavior as LRU, but with better internal eviction decisions.
